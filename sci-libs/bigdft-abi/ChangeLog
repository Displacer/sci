  17 Jun 2013; Honza Macháček <Hloupy.Honza@centrum.cz>
  +bigdft-abi-1.0.4.ebuild, +files/bigdft-abi-1.0.4-tests.tar.bz2:
  sci-libs/bigdft-abi-1.0.4 added. Replaces sci-libs/bigdft as a library of
  sci-physics/abinit. Based on former sci-libs/bigdft ebuilds, usage of
  LIBDIR/finclude abandoned in favour of /usr/include, as used upstream.

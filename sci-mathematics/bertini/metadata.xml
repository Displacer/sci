Bertini: Software for Numerical Algebraic Geometry

Facts in brief:

    Purpose: The numerical solution of systems of polynomial equations

    Approach: Homotopy continuation.
    
    Authors: Daniel J. Bates, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler
    
    Background: Bertini is a general-purpose solver, written in C, that was
    created for research about polynomial continuation.

    Cost: Bertini is distributed free of charge on an ``as is'' basis with no
    warranties, implied or otherwise, that it is suitable for any purpose. Its
    intended usage is educational, so that the user may gain a greater
    understanding of numerical homotopy continuation for solving systems of
    polynomial equations. Any other use is strictly the user's
    responsibility. Please see the official license policy.
